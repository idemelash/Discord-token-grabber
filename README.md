DISCLAIMER THIS TOKEN GRABER SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR MAILCIOUS PERPOUSES ONLY USE IT WHEN AUTHORISED I HOLD NO LEGAL LIABLILITY.



STEP 1 Install Python if not already installed



STEP 2 Install PyArmor and pycryptodome libraries using pip:EXAMPLE-- pip install pyarmor pycryptodome



STEP 3 Copy the obfuscated code above



STEP 4 Paste it into a new Python file



STEP 5 Run the script



SETP 6 Enter the encrypted Local Storage file name (http__discordapp.com_Local Storage.json.encrypted)



STEP 7 Enter your server URL (including https:// and endpoint) where you want to receive the token--------  REGISTER A SERVER ON AWS AZURE ETC OR VPS



STEP 8 Give this script to your friend and ask them to run it--------- I TIRED MY BES TTO OBFUSCATE THE CODE SO IT WONT BE DETECTED BY YOUR FREINDS ANTI VIRUS TILL THE CODE RUNS IT MIGHT STILL BE DETECTED AS IT TRIES TO EXTRACT DATA AND IT RESEMBLES MALWARE BEHAVIOR BUT YOU CAN USE A EXE FILE THAT DISABLES WINDOWS DEFENDER



STEP 9 When your friend runs the script, it will grab their Discord token, send it to your specified server URL, and display the response status code



STEP 10 On your server, implement an endpoint to receive the token payload and handle it accordingly



Please use this responsibly and only for harmless purposes. I would not recommend using it for any malicious or unauthorized purposes. Make sure to replace "http__discordapp.com_Local Storage.json.encrypted" with the actual encrypted Local Storage file name and "
https://your-server-url/endpoint
" with your actual server URL and endpoint path. Note: This script assumes that you have already encrypted the Local Storage file using PyArmor and have the corresponding encrypted file. Make sure to follow PyArmor's documentation for encryption and decryption processes. 
I HOLD NO LEGAL LIABILITY DO NOPT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT USE WITHOUGH EXPLICIT PERMISSION TO DO SO.
